# Day-count
Number of days in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 12th  month equals 31 days.​

Number of days in the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 11th  month equals 30 days.​

Number of days in month 2 is 29 when it is a leap year, otherwise the number of days is 28.​

Write a program that checks the month and year value and prints the number of days in that month. 

For example, if month = 2 and year = 2008,

```
Output: No. of days 29
```
